### Data Sources
The dataset used is Employee dataset of Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd. which I created. It contains detailed information such as :
- Employee ID
- Employee full Name
- Department ( communications, sales, I.T)
- Salary (between $5,000 to $25,000)
- Job type ( part-time, freelance, contract).

### Tools
Excel

### Data Cleaning
I performed the following tasks:
- I created a dataset with 20 rows of information.
- Using the filter function in the "sort and filter bar", I was able to show only employees who are freelancers. In thesame worksheet, Iused the "highlight cell rules" in the "conditional formatting" to highlight those freelancers whose salaries are above $10,000.
- I used the "Text to column" function to seperate the "full names" into "first name" amd "last name". In thesame worksheet, I used the "highlight cell rules" under "conditional formatting" to highlight duplicate values.
- I usef the "new rule" in "conditional formatting" to format the highest salary to green background and the lowest salary to red background.
In the "new rule" option which I worked with, I formatted only top and bottom ranked values, but however reduced both values to 1 for both top ranked value and bottom ranked value.

### Explanatory Data Analysis
This has to do with explaining the employee data to asnwer certain questions like: who receives the highest salary; who receives the lowest salary; what Job pays the highest and what job pays the lowest salary.

From our analysis, I was able to show that the higest salary by formatting it to a green backgroung and the lowest to red backgroung in worksheeet three.
this means that "communications" pays the highest salary while I.T pays the least.
