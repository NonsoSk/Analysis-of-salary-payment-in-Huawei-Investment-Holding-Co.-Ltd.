This is an Excel task, that shows the analysis of salaries paid by Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd. to its different employees.

The aim is primarily to examine the variation in payment of salaries across the various departments of the company in order to make proper increment where necessary.

However, Using a dataset with 20 rows of information we shall copy and paste the table to worksheet 2 amd worksheet 3 and then solve the following problems:

- In worksheet one(1), show only employees who are freelancers and highlight the ones whose salaries are above $10000
- In worksheet 2,split Employees full names into first name and last name. Check for duplicates and highlight if any (do not delete).
- In worksheet 3, highlight employees whose names begin with the letter "E" (in yellow). Format the salary column such that the highest salary has green background and the lowest salary has a red background.

### Data Sources
The dataset used is Employee dataset of Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd. which I created. It contains detailed information such as :
- Employee ID
- Employee full Name
- Department ( communications, sales, I.T)
- Salary (between $5,000 to $25,000)
- Job type ( part-time, freelance, contract).

### Tools
Excel

### Data Cleaning
The dataset I created with 20 rows of information was not clean enough and so I had to clean thus:

- Using filter, I was able to show only employees who are freelancers. In thesame worksheet, I highlighted those freelancers whose salaries are above $10,000. This Iachieved using conditional formatting. 
- I splite the "full names" into "first name" amd "last name". In thesame worksheet, and then highlighted duplicate values.
- I used the "new rule" in "conditional formatting" to format the highest salary to green background and the lowest salary to red background.

### Explanatory  Analysis
Using the very basic formulars and functions in excel, I chose to create a very simple dashboard to reflect my analysis. I used the colors "red" and "yellow" as a reflection of the company and her country`s color and then " green" to show highest value. 
From our analysis, we could see the following:

In worksheet One, we see that:

- Only two out of 7 freelancers are earning below $10,000
- The freelancers earning below $10,000 all work in the sales department.
- However there are other employees working in the sales department who earn more than $10,000
- Only one employee from the communications department work as a freelancer.

Here is the dashboard I came up with:
