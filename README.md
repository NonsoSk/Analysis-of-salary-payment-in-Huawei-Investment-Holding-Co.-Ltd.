## overview
This is an Excel task, that shows the analysis of salaries paid by Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd. to its different employees.

The aim is primarily to examine the variation in payment of salaries across the various departments of the company in order to make proper increment where necessary.

However, Using a dataset with 20 rows of information we shall copy and paste the table to worksheet 2 amd worksheet 3 and then solve the following problems:

- In worksheet one(1), show only employees who are freelancers and highlight the ones whose salaries are above $10000
- In worksheet 2,split Employees full names into first name and last name. Check for duplicates and highlight if any (do not delete).
- In worksheet 3, highlight employees whose names begin with the letter "E" (in yellow). Format the salary column such that the highest salary has green background and the lowest salary has a red background.

## Problem Statement:
- To trace the highest paid job type
- To trace the highest and lowest paid employee
- To get the job type that needs increment in salary

## Data Sources
The dataset used is Employee dataset of Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd. which I created. It contains detailed information such as :
- Employee ID
- Employee full Name
- Department ( communications, sales, I.T)
- Salary (between $5,000 to $25,000)
- Job type ( part-time, freelance, contract).

## Tools
Excel

## Data Cleaning
The dataset I created with 20 rows of information was not clean enough and so I had to clean thus:

- Using filter, I was able to show only employees who are freelancers. In thesame worksheet, I highlighted those freelancers whose salaries are above $10,000. This Iachieved using conditional formatting. 
- I splite the "full names" into "first name" amd "last name". In thesame worksheet, and then highlighted duplicate values.
- I used the "new rule" in "conditional formatting" to format the highest salary to green background and the lowest salary to red background.

## Explanatory  Analysis
Using the very basic formulars and functions in excel, I chose to create a very simple dashboard to reflect my analysis. I used the colors "red" and "yellow" as a reflection of the company and her country`s color and then " green" to show highest value. 
From our analysis, we could see the following:

**worksheet One, we see that:**

- Only two out of 7 freelancers are earning below $10,000
- The freelancers earning below $10,000 all work in the sales department.
- However there are other employees working in the sales department who earn more than $10,000
- Only one employee from the communications department work as a freelancer.

**Here is the dashboard I came up with:**

 **In worksheet two, we can also see that:**

 - Despite highlighting duplicate values, no two employees had exact data ranging from their ID through their names down to the type of job they did in the company.
 **Below is the dashboard we built to support this:**

**In worksheet three:**

- The employee who earns the highest salary works as a freelancer in the communications department.
- The employee who earns the lowest salary works as part-time in the I.T department.
 **The dashboard below shows this:**

## Recommendation and Conclusion
- I realized that a greater number of freelancers are paid above $10,000 and the two who are paid below that are both of thesame department (sales). This means that freelancing is really lucrative especially in a company like Huawei Investment & Holding Co., Ltd. However, the low payment of the other two freelancers must be as a result of the  problem from their department. The sales department should thus encourage their freelancers to work harder.
- I realized that the highest paid employee is a freelancer and flowing from our first point ( that five out of seven freelancers earn more than $10,000), it is clear that the company values freelancers more than part-time and contract workers. I thus recommend that more oppourtunities be provided for freelancers and an increment be made irrespective of the department.
- I also realized that the least paid employee works in the I.T department and as a part-time. As a part-time worker, his salary is justifiable.
